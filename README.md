<h1>👋 Hi! I'm Ilya </h1> 
  
<p> I'm a stage/ screen Actor turned Web-Developer from Toronto, Canada. I use my endless passion for coding and design to build and develop web content that is user-friendly, intuitive and most importantly, accessible to all. </p>

📖 I’m currently polishing my React skills by working on a simple Netflix-like movie app using the Movie DB API (coming soon)!

💗 Also, I'm a sucker for animations. GSAP absolutely blows my mind. Therefore, I am trying to teach myself the power of GSAP, one tween at a time!

⛺ When I'm not coding or acting, I'm usually out hiking/ camping or planning my next trip abroad.
