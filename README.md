<h1> Hello and Welcome, I'm Ilya! </h1> 
  
ðŸ‘‹ I'm a stage/ screen Actor turned Web-Developer from Toronto, Canada. I use my endless passion for coding and design to build and develop web content that is user-friendly, intuitive and most importantly, accessible to all.

ðŸ“– Iâ€™m currently polishing my React skills by working on a simple Netflix-like movie app called Hackflix using the Movie DB API!

ðŸ’— Also, I'm a sucker for animations. GSAP absolutely blows my mind. Therefore, I am trying to teach myself the power of GSAP, one tween at a time!

â›º When I'm not coding or acting, I'm usually out hiking/ camping or planning my next trip abroad.
